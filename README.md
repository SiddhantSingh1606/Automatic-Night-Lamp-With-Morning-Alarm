In our day-to-day life, we are used to several automatic electrical and electronics appliances such as automatic cooker, temperature based automatic speed adjustable fan, automatic iron box, automatic washing machines, automatic coolers, and so on. During night time we are used to switch on night lamps or bed lamps and wake up with an alarm set in the morning at a specific time.
